# BAS-Research-Project [Discontinued]
This repository contains my work for a remote intern under [Prof. Shuai Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H8UOWqoAAAAJ&hl=en) on Beetle Antenna Search Optimisation. My guide for this work was [Prof. Atajahangir Moshayedi](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=nLz_vcoAAAAJ&hl=en). I worked on implementing it for ground vehicle navigation, obstacle avoidance and was looking into ways of involving it with Spiking Neural Networks - for robotic arm control optimisation. Unfortunately due to the start of my college semester and other ongoing commitments, I was unable to continue this work.
